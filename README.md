## Introduction

This project showcases how to perform linear regression on a dataset containing mileage and price of cars. The dataset is used to train a model using gradient descent, and the learning process is animated to show how the regression line evolves over iterations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alprivalov/linear-regression-animation.git
    cd linear-regression-animation
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3. Place your dataset `data.csv` in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

Run the main script to train the model and display the animation:
```bash
python main.py
